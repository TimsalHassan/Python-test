Problem 2:-
    Explain the difference between for and while and doWhile loops in Python. Provide examples of when to use each.

# for loop: 
"We use for when we know the number of iterations. It is used for sequential travesel of data types. "
# # Example : 
# input_number = int(input("Enter the number: "))
# for num in range(1, input_number):
#     print(str(num)*num)

# while loop:
"we use while when we don't know the number the iterations. It is used when we work on an iterator and we update its value and we have a condition that's need to be implemented which is not certain."
# # Example :
# n = int(input("Enter the number: "))
# while n > 0:
#     num = n % 10
#     print(num)
#     n = n // 10

# Do While loop:
" It is similar to while loop but in it the code is executed first then the condition is checked"
